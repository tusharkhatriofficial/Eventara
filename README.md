## What is Eventara?

Eventara is an open-source, self-hosted platform that helps you monitor and understand what's happening in your applications in real-time. Send events from your services, define alert rules, and get notified instantly when something goes wrong.
Built for: Startups that can't afford expensive monitoring tools, mid-sized companies needing customizable observability, and enterprises wanting full control over their data.

## Core Concept

Your Application  →  Eventara  →  Real-Time Analytics + Intelligent Alerts

**Example Use Cases:**

- Monitor payment failures and alert your team before users complain
- Track signup rates and detect sudden drops instantly 
- Analyze user behavior patterns in real-time
- Get notified when API error rates spike
- Monitor IoT sensor data and trigger actions on anomalies


## Built With Modern Tech Stack

- Backend: Spring Boot microservices (Java 17+)
- Messaging: Apache Kafka for high-throughput event streaming
- Storage: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for time-series data
- Cache: Redis for fast metric access
- Analytics: Kafka Streams for real-time processing
- Communication: gRPC for internal services, REST for external APIs
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes ready
